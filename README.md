## Simple housing for SiLabs ThunderBoard Sense (and Sense 2)

The housing was designed using Autodesk Fusion 360. It was meant for a research study where the participants wore the ThunderBoard as a badge and used the buttons to give feedback regarding the environment. Please feel free to extend and improve the features of the housing. At the moment the lid snaps in to the four slots (I have used white glue to keep it stable).

The base contains two pegs (is that the right name?) which matches with the holes on the board:

Have fun!
